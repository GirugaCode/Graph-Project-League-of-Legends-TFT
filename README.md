# CS 2.2 Graph Modeling Project - League of Legends Team Fight Tactics Item System

## Project Description
I will be modeling a Graph ADT (Abstract Data Structure) to take in data of all the items in TFT(Team Fight Tactics). With it, I will be introducing a set of problems and solve them using graph theory in python. The input data will be small but the project will be able to scope and scale to a real world problem.

## Project Problems
- Finding all the combination of smaller items
- Which item combos goes best with which character
- Based on the items you currently have, what items can you make
